You are a senior full-stack engineer.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
This is an existing production-ready student tools platform called **StuDENT**.
Tech stack already exists:
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
- Backend: Node.js + Express
- Structure already implemented (do NOT restructure folders unnecessarily)
- UI already built and working
- Categories already present (Calculators, Image Tools, PDF Tools, Student Tools, AI Tools)

GOAL:
Upgrade the platform from demo-level tools to **professionally working real tools**.
Do NOT break existing tools or UI.
Enhance functionality, accuracy, and performance.

==============================
STRICT RULES
==============================
- Do NOT delete existing tools
- Do NOT change routing structure
- Do NOT add paid APIs unless explicitly instructed
- Do NOT expose API keys in frontend
- Keep all tools FREE
- Keep limits clearly defined in UI
- Prefer client-side processing wherever possible
- Add loading states, progress indicators, and error handling

==============================
PHASE 1 — IMAGE TOOLS (CLIENT-SIDE)
==============================
Implement real image processing using browser-based libraries.

Use:
- browser-image-compression
- canvas APIs

Tools to implement:
1. Image Compressor
   - User uploads image
   - User selects target output size (KB slider)
   - Compress image to nearest possible size
   - Show original vs compressed size
   - Allow download

2. Image Resize
   - Width/Height input
   - Maintain aspect ratio option

3. Image Format Converter
   - JPG ↔ PNG ↔ WEBP

4. Image Quality Reducer
   - Quality slider (1–100)

All processing must happen in browser (NO server usage).

==============================
PHASE 2 — AUDIO TOOLS (FFMPEG.WASM)
==============================
Use @ffmpeg/ffmpeg (WASM).

Tools:
1. Audio Compressor (MP3/WAV)
2. Audio Trim
3. Audio Converter (WAV → MP3)
4. Audio Speed Control

Rules:
- Max file size: 50 MB
- Show progress bar
- Handle unsupported formats gracefully

==============================
PHASE 3 — VIDEO TOOLS (LIMITED BUT REAL)
==============================
Use ffmpeg.wasm for SMALL/MEDIUM videos only.

Tools:
1. Video Trim
2. Video Compress (lower bitrate + resolution)
3. Video → Audio (MP3)

Rules:
- Max file size: 100 MB
- Clear warning about browser limitations
- Show progress and estimated time

==============================
PHASE 4 — PDF TOOLS (CLIENT-SIDE FIRST)
==============================
Use pdf-lib.

Tools:
1. PDF Merge
2. PDF Split
3. PDF Compress
4. PDF Rotate
5. Images → PDF

Rules:
- No OCR
- No server processing
- Show file size before/after

==============================
PHASE 5 — AI TOOLS (REAL OUTPUT, NOT DUMMY)
==============================
Fix AI tools so they stop returning random or fake outputs.

Backend-only AI integration.

Use:
- Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash)
- Free tier only

Implement backend routes for:
1. Text Summarizer
2. Essay Generator
3. Grammar Checker
4. Notes Generator
5. Question Generator

Rules:
- API key stored in backend env only
- Frontend calls backend endpoints
- Add character limits
- Add loading + error states
- Clean, structured responses (not raw dumps)

==============================
UX & QUALITY REQUIREMENTS
==============================
- Each tool page must show:
  - Tool description
  - File limits
  - Clear CTA
- Add drag & drop for file tools
- Add skeleton loaders
- Add success + error messages
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

==============================
DELIVERABLE
==============================
- Fully working tools (not placeholders)
- Clean code
- No breaking changes
- Professional behavior similar to top tools websites
- All tools remain free

Proceed step-by-step.
Start with IMAGE TOOLS first.
