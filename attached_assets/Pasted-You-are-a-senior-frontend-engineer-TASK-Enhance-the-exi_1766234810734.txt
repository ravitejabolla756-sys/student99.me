You are a senior frontend engineer.

TASK:
Enhance the existing StuDENT website UI with two upgrades only:
1) A scroll indicator animation on the landing page hero section
2) A premium theme switcher with named themes (not light/dark)

DO NOT redesign the layout, cards, spacing, or typography.
Keep everything minimal, fast, and professional.

========================
1) LANDING PAGE SCROLL ANIMATION
========================
Add a subtle scroll indicator at the bottom-center of the hero section.

Design:
- Mouse-outline style scroll indicator
- A small dot inside the mouse moves vertically (top → bottom → reset)
- Smooth infinite animation (1.8s duration, ease-in-out)
- Opacity ~70%, not distracting
- Optional small text below: “Scroll”

Behavior:
- Indicator auto-hides (fade-out) once the user scrolls down even slightly
- Must not block clicks or affect layout
- Desktop only (hide on small mobile screens)

Implementation:
- Use pure CSS animations (no external libraries)
- Add minimal JS only to detect scroll and hide indicator
- Keep markup clean and reusable

========================
2) THEME SWITCHER (TOP RIGHT)
========================
Replace the current light/dark toggle with a theme selector.

UI:
- Icon button in top-right (palette or circle icon)
- On click, open a small floating dropdown panel
- Each theme shows:
  - Color preview dot
  - Theme name
  - Active theme checkmark

Themes to implement (start with these 4):
1) Midnight
   - Dark background (current theme)
   - Blue accent
2) Minimal
   - White background
   - Soft gray borders
   - Dark text
3) Solar
   - Light yellow background
   - Black text
   - Yellow accent highlights
4) Slate
   - Muted gray-blue background
   - Calm, low-contrast look

Behavior:
- Theme applies instantly
- Persist selected theme using localStorage
- Default theme: Midnight
- Smooth transition when switching themes (background, text, borders)

Implementation rules:
- Use CSS variables for colors
- No inline styles
- No external UI libraries
- No performance-heavy animations

========================
GLOBAL RULES
========================
- Do NOT change existing tool cards or routes
- Do NOT break current functionality
- Keep animations subtle and premium
- Follow existing Tailwind / CSS structure
- Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus states)

OUTPUT EXPECTATION:
- Add necessary CSS
- Add minimal JS where required
- Integrate cleanly into existing codebase
- No placeholder text, everything production-ready
