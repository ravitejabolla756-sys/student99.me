You are a senior creative frontend engineer.

GOAL:
Upgrade the landing page of the StuDENT website with a FULL-PAGE, SCROLL-REACTIVE BACKGROUND ANIMATION.
This animation must react smoothly as the user scrolls.

IMPORTANT:
This is NOT a small scroll icon.
This is NOT a loader.
This is a subtle, immersive background motion across the entire hero section.

Do NOT redesign layout, text, buttons, or cards.

========================
BACKGROUND SCROLL ANIMATION (HERO SECTION)
========================
Apply a dynamic background animation to the full landing page hero section.

Animation concept:
- Background elements move slowly based on scroll position
- Creates a “depth / parallax / wonder” effect
- Feels premium, calm, and modern
- No distraction to text readability

Visual style (choose ONE clean approach):
Option A: Floating gradient blobs
- Soft blurred shapes
- Move vertically at different speeds while scrolling
- Very low opacity (10–20%)

Option B: Grid / noise motion
- Subtle noise or dot grid
- Position shifts slightly with scroll
- Gives a tech / futuristic student vibe

Option C: Light wave motion
- Soft abstract waves
- Slowly translate upward as user scrolls down
- No sharp lines or bright colors

========================
SCROLL BEHAVIOR
========================
- Background reacts continuously to scrollY value
- Use requestAnimationFrame for smoothness
- Movement must be slow (parallax ratio 0.1–0.3)
- Animation stops once hero section is passed

========================
TECHNICAL RULES
========================
- Use pure CSS + minimal JS
- Use CSS variables for transform values
- No external animation libraries (no GSAP, no Lottie)
- Must not affect performance or FPS
- Must work smoothly on desktop
- Disable or reduce motion on mobile automatically

========================
ACCESSIBILITY
========================
- Respect prefers-reduced-motion
- If reduced motion is enabled, keep background static
- Ensure text contrast stays readable at all times

========================
INTEGRATION RULES
========================
- Apply only to landing page hero section
- Do NOT affect dashboard or tools pages
- No DOM restructuring
- No breaking changes

========================
OUTPUT EXPECTATION
========================
- Add background layers (divs or pseudo-elements)
- Add scroll listener logic
- Smooth transitions
- Clean, production-ready code
